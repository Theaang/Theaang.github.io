## <span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: bold;">About me</span>

I am an senior undergraduate student at Mount Holyoke College, majoring in Neuroscience and Mathematics. I conduct independent research in the [SomNeuro Lab](https://www.somneurolab.com/) with Dr Rebecca Spencer and in the [Hengen Lab](https://hengenlab.org/) with Dr. Keith Hengen.

I study systems and computational neuroscience. My research investigates how neural computation arises across scales, from single-neuron spiking and population subspace representations to large-scale oscillatory and aperiodic dynamics that structure information processing across temporal and spatial dimensions. I integrate scalp and intracranial electrophysiology with neuroimaging, and combine these data with theory-driven dynamical systems and neural network models to examine how neural dynamics coordinate information flow across wake and sleep to support flexible cognition and memory reorganization.

In addition to empirical research, I develop pipelines in Python and R to improve signal processing, dimensionality reduction, and closed-loop stimulation in neural time series. I evaluate how conventional preprocessing, normalization, and averaging procedures distort neural structure by collapsing complex dynamics into fixed dimensions, and build hierarchical and multivariate models that preserve behavioral and neural variability . I am committed to open science through code and data sharing, rigorous analysis, and methodological practices that support reproducible research.

Outside of research, I enjoy music, traveling, hiking, advocating neurodiversity, learning new languages, and social justice. Learn more about what I [support...](https://theaang.github.io/miscellaneous/#i-support)
