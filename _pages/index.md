## <span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: bold;">About me</span>

I am an senior undergraduate student at Mount Holyoke College, majoring in Neuroscience and Mathematics. I am currently conducting independent research in [SomNeuro Lab](https://www.somneurolab.com/) and [Hengen Lab](https://hengenlab.org/), supervised by Dr. Rebecca Spencer and Dr. Keith Hengen.

I study systems and computational neuroscience, focusing on how neural dynamics, including oscillatory and aperiodic networks, connectivity, and neural criticality, support brain communication and computations. I am particularly interested in their roles in memory, sleep, and learning. I combine empirical techniques (electrophysiology, neuroimaging, and brain stimulation) with computational modeling to answer these questions.

In addition to original research, I am developing novel modeling and detection methods in Python & R, and critically evaluating the issues of current methodologies in cognitive and neurosciences. I am currently implementing of neural network models, dynamical systems & chaos, and probability theory in neuroscience research. I advocate for open science, reproducible research practices, and the proper use and interpretation of statistics. 

Outside of research, I enjoy music, traveling, hiking, community services, learning new languages, and social justice. Learn more about what I [support...](https://theaang.github.io/miscellaneous/#i-support)
