## **RESEARCH EXPERIENCES**

**SomNeuro Lab, University of Massachusetts Amherst** <br>
June 2023 – Present <br>
Principal Investigator: Dr. Rebecca Spencer <br>

Project 2: Traveling waves coordinate cross-frequency coupling <br>
March 2024 – Present <br>
• Investigated large-scale coordination of sleep dynamics by modeling inter-regional traveling wave trains and their role in memory consolidation across simultaneous behavioral, high-density PSG, fMRI, and DTI datasets.<br>
• Designed flexible multi-Gaussian curve-fitting algorithms and unsupervised classifiers for detecting sleep spindles and slow oscillations, accounting for individual variability in oscillatory frequency and morphology.<br>
• Implemented comprehensive analyses combining phase gradient directionality (PGD) and inter-wave temporal synchronization to quantify the spatial organization and propagation of traveling waves, revealing hierarchical information processing dynamics during nREM sleep.<br>
• Characterized bidirectional interactions between traveling wave dynamics and slow oscillation-spindle coupling, demonstrating that the hierarchical timing structure of traveling waves predicts coupling phase and strength, whereas coupled traveling wave trains exhibit more consistent spatiotemporal propagation direction.<br>
• Pioneered neural network models to simulate the occurrences and interactions of traveling waves during sleep.<br>
• Improved and generalized computational behavioral methods, including the drift-diffusion model (DDM) and unequal-variance signal detection theory (UVSDT), to measure time-drifted changes in memory consolidation.<br>
• Developed automated pipelines and interfaces in Python for high-density PSG data preprocessing, cleaning, spectral analysis, event detection, and spatiotemporal analysis.<br>
• Advised other labmates in advanced time-series analysis, spectral analysis, data cleaning, and visualization.<br>
• Facilitated the lab’s transition to Python for the electrophysiology and neuroimaging analysis.

Project 3: TMR-evoked traveling waves unify sleep-wake memory dynamics <br>
June 2025 – Present <br>
• Developed a novel behavioral paradigm that separates neural signals across visual, auditory, motor, and spatial levels to decode how targeted auditory stimulation during nREM sleep reorganizes memory representations.<br>
• Implemented an automatic closed-loop TMR protocol delivering auditory cues precisely at slow-oscillation up- and down-states to examine state-dependent modulation of memory reactivation and network synchronization.<br>
• Developing multivariate pipelines that combine representational similarity analysis and cross-state decoding to track item-level memory reorganization across encoding, wake and sleep-dependent consolidation, and retrieval.<br>
• Quantifying cross-frequency coupled traveling waves to identify shared, decodable propagation pathways linking slow oscillation-spindle waves during nREM sleep with theta-alpha waves during wake across the same cue-aligned trials, characterizing their computational role in memory reorganization.<br>
• Extending dynamic system modeling and temporal renormalization group-based autoregressive metrics to test how proximity to criticality supports long-range communication and gains in memory precision and confidence.<br>

Project 1: Bayesian meta-analysis in slow oscillation-spindle coupling <br>
June 2023 – March 2024 <br>
• Applied the Bayesian hierarchical model in R to conduct a meta-analysis of 297 effect sizes, examining the 
relationship between memory consolidation and phase-amplitude coupling of neural oscillations during sleep.<br>
• Applied advanced statistical analysis approaches, including non-linear hypothesis testing, leave-one-out cross-validation, distribution approximation & transformation, and simulation to include multi-level moderators in meta-analysis and solve complex statistical problems beyond the scope of existing functions.<br>
• Re-evaluated the statistical power, robustness, and properties of the circular-linear regression in the phase-amplitude coupling, and developed novel standardization methods to approximate a normal distribution.<br>
• Revealed that precise and strong SO-fast SP coupling in the frontal lobe predicts memory consolidation, with the strength of this association mediated by memory type, aging, and dynamic spatiotemporal features.<br>

**Washington University in St. Louis & NIH ENDURE program** <br>
June 2025 – Present <br>
Principal Investigators: Drs. Keith Hengen, Deanna Barch, Joan Luby <br>
• Leading research in neural criticality and computational efficiency across species and recording scales using human EEG, sEEG, fMRI, as well as LFP and spike datasets of rodents, by extending temporal renormalization group (tRG) theory to multiscale neural systems.<br>
• Developed autoregressive (AR) and multivariate stochastic differential equation (SDE) models to simulate, decompose, and distinguish critical and oscillatory dynamics in continuous, discretized, and discrete signals, providing parameter optimization frameworks for empirical data analysis.<br>
• Implemented AR modeling on empirical data to quantify criticality across temporal reaches and multiple signal representations, including filtered, envelope, and mode decomposed forms, enabling within- and between-stage analyses of how criticality evolves across wake-sleep transitions.<br>
• Identified sleep as a restorative process that reestablishes critical neural dynamics and optimizes computation in humans, revealing distinct stage- and region-specific signatures across cortical and subcortical structures.<br>
• Performed longitudinal analyses spanning infancy (9 months) through early childhood (8 years), characterizing developmental trajectories in the reemergence of criticality across sleep-wake transitions.<br>
• Designed and trained a machine learning classifier to predict spontaneous awakening events based on pre- arousal fluctuations in neural criticality, contributing to early markers of arousal transitions.<br>
• Integrating behavioral assessments with electrophysiological measures to examine how deviations from criticality correlate with individual differences in neuropsychiatric development.<br>
• Due to NIH funding suspension, my ENDURE experience was fully funded by the Department of Psychiatry.

**Chemers Neustein Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Program, The Rockefeller University** <br>

Principal Investigator: Dr. Winrich Freiwald <br>
• Researched inter-area interactions of neural representations under the mentorship of Dr. Lucas Tian and Dr. Winrich Freiwald (PI) in the Laboratory of Neural Systems, supported by the Rockefeller SURF Fellowship.

• Discovered dynamic shifts in inter-area communication of neural representation across various phases of multi-step action planning and execution sequences using cross-correlations and custom permutation tests.  
• Adopted the model of communication subspace to explore brain connections at the sub-population level, and revealed the hierarchical directionality of communications during actions.  
•  Collaborated on a program-wide group project examining the neurobiological impacts of aging, focusing on impaired neurogenesis, cellular-immune interactions, and their roles in cognitive decline.
