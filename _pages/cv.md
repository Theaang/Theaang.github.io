## **RESEARCH EXPERIENCES**
**Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst** <br>
March 2024 - Ongoing  
• Studying the grouping of interactions of inter-area traveling waves as trains by designing multi-level behavioral-PSG-fMRI analysis using both traditional and computational methods, under the supervision of Dr. Rebecca Spencer (PI) in the SomNeuro lab.  
• Designed multi-Gaussian curve fitting and unsupervised classifiers to detect sleep spindle and slow oscillation characteristics flexibly to account for individual differences in frequencies of neural oscillations.  
• Pioneering neural network models to predict the occurrences and interactions of traveling waves during sleep.  
• Developing machine learning methods to detect inter-regional phase-amplitude coupling of sleep waves based on rhythmic networks and spatiotemporal compositions.  
• Improved and generalized computational behavioral methods, including the drift-diffusion model (DDM) and unequal-variance signal detection theory (UVSDT), to measure time drifted changes in memory consolidation.  
• Developed automated pipelines and interfaces for high-density Polysomnography data preprocessing, cleaning, spectral analysis, event detection, and spatiotemporal analysis.  
• Advising other labmates in advanced time-series analysis, spectral analysis, data cleaning, and visualization.  
• Facilitating the lab’s transition to Python for the electrophysiology and neuroimaging analysis.  

June 2023 - March 2024 <br>
• Applied the Bayesian hierarchical model in R to conduct a meta-analysis of 297 effect sizes, examining the relationship between memory consolidation and phase-amplitude coupling of neural oscillations during sleep.  
• Applied advanced statistical analysis approaches including non-linear hypothesis testing, leave-one-out cross-validation, distribution approximation & transformation, and simulation to include multi-level moderators in meta-analysis and solve complex statistical problems beyond the scope of existing functions.  
• Re-evaluated the statistical power, robustness, and properties of the circular-linear regression in the phase-amplitude coupling, and developed novel standardization methods to approximate a normal distribution.  
• Revealed that precise and strong SO-fast SP coupling in the frontal lobe predicts memory consolidation, with the strength of this association mediated by memory type, aging, and dynamic spatiotemporal features.  

**Chemers Neustein Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Program, The Rockefeller University** <br>
June 2024 – September 2024 <br>
• Researched inter-area interactions of neural representations under the mentorship of Dr. Lucas Tian and Dr. Winrich Freiwald (PI) in the Laboratory of Neural Systems, supported by the Rockefeller SURF Fellowship.  
• Developed moment-to-moment logistic regression decoders to extract shape and location representations of visual-motor integration from multi-neuron activity recorded across multiple brain regions in macaque monkeys.  
• Discovered dynamic shifts in inter-area communication of neural representation across various phases of multi-step action planning and execution sequences using cross-correlations and custom permutation tests.  
• Adopted the model of communication subspace to explore brain connections at the sub-population level, and revealed the hierarchical directionality of communications during actions.  
•  Collaborated on a program-wide group project examining the neurobiological impacts of aging, focusing on impaired neurogenesis, cellular-immune interactions, and their roles in cognitive decline.

June 2023 – August 2023 <br>

August 2021 – July 2022 <br>
• Studied the impact of unconscious cognitive gender bias in information processing and decision-making process. Studied probability modeling and inference. Assisted in process tracing and computer simulation under the supervision of Dr. Li.  
• Collected data and conducted data analysis, built and assessed multiple logistic regression models.  

**Department of Economics, University of Cambridge (remote)** <br>
March 2021 – July 2021 <br>
• Under the guidance of Prof. Gallo from the University of Cambridge, studied the impacts of confirmation bias on investment decisions and effective strategies to reduce the extent of impacts by the intersection of psychology, probability, and economics.  
• Worked on the design and collection of questionnaires, modeling, and data analysis in SPSS.
