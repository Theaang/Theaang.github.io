## Learning-Dependent Modulation of Local Neural Dynamics across Wake and Sleep

This study establishes a state-dependent cascade through which learning-induced neural plasticity during wakefulness reorganizes local sleep dynamics to support memory consolidation. High-density EEG revealed that learning produced focal flattening of the aperiodic spectral slope in frontocentral regions during pre-sleep wakefulness. Individuals showing the strongest flattening subsequently expressed the largest increases in local sleep depth in the same region, indicating that wake-related spectral changes mediate local sleep reorganization. During nREM sleep, this process is represented as region-specific increases in slow-wave activity, decreases in sigma power, and altered slow oscillation morphology, without accompanying global changes in sleep macrostructure. Pre-sleep aperiodic slope was associated with immediate recall performance, while local non-rapid-eye-movement enhancement predicted post-sleep recall gains, and global metrics were not predictive. Principal component analysis  showed that co-modulation across frontocentral and temporal regions forms a unified spatial mode of sleep-dependent plasticity linking wake-induced cortical reorganization to subsequent memory consolidation. Together, these findings demonstrate that declarative learning leads to a regionally specific alteration of cortical excitation during wakefulness, which is subsequently reinstated during sleep as enhanced local sleep depth, revealing a pathway through which waking neural plasticity is transformed into consolidated memory representations.
