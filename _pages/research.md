## **Summer programs**

**2025** <br>
I led a theory-driven project with Drs. Keith Hengen, Deanna Barch, and Joan Luby at Washington University in St. Louis, extending temporal renormalization group theory to develop and validate an autoregressive metric to quantify neural criticality across recording modalities. Using sinusoidal perturbations in dynamic systems models, I identified sampling and model parameters that isolate aperiodic near-critical dynamics from both continuous and discrete signals, then applied them to rodent spiking and LFP data and human EEG and stereo-EEG. Presented at SfN 2025, this work showed that nREM sleep restores criticality and that deviations from this pattern reflect developmental and neuropsychiatric differences.

**2024** <br>
I collaborated with Dr. Lucas Tian and Dr. Winrich Freiwald in the Laboratory of Neural Systems at Rockefeller University. We quantified inter-area interactions of neural representations during action sequences in macaque monkeys, as well as the hierarchical directionality of communication during actions. This research was fully funded by Rockefeller University's Chemers Neustein Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF).

**2023** <br>
I worked on a remote project on generative models in machine learning with Dr. Baptista from the California Institute of Technology. Our group researched the optimal transportation, Bayesian inferences, and data assimilation.
