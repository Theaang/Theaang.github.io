## **Neural Dynamics and Computation**

Traditional approaches to neuroscience often attempt to link brain and mind by collapsing complex neural activity and adaptive behavior into static metrics, obscuring the spatial and temporal structure embedded in neural time series. Such reductions treat the brain as a collection of fixed endpoints rather than a nonlinear dynamic system whose functions emerge through continual reorganization. My work challenges this paradigm by investigating how neural dynamics coordinate information flow across changing brain states, from millisecond scale task-related processing to wake-sleep transitions, to support flexible cognition. Addressing this problem requires theoretical frameworks and empirical data analysis that integrate multiple scales. I am particularly interested in how single neuron spiking and population level subspaces interact with, and are constrained by, large-scale network structure and rhythmic activity, including oscillatory and aperiodic components, to implement efficient brain computation and information integration.

## **Summer programs**

**2025** <br>
I led a theory-driven project with Drs. Keith Hengen, Deanna Barch, and Joan Luby at Washington University in St. Louis, extending temporal renormalization group theory to develop and validate an autoregressive metric to quantify neural criticality across recording modalities. Using sinusoidal perturbations in dynamic systems models, I identified sampling and model parameters that isolate aperiodic near-critical dynamics from both continuous and discrete signals, then applied them to rodent spiking and LFP data and human EEG and stereo-EEG. Presented at SfN 2025, this work showed that nREM sleep restores criticality and that deviations from this pattern reflect developmental and neuropsychiatric differences.

**2024** <br>
I collaborated with Dr. Lucas Tian and Dr. Winrich Freiwald in the Laboratory of Neural Systems at Rockefeller University. We quantified inter-area interactions of neural representations during action sequences in macaque monkeys, as well as the hierarchical directionality of communication during actions. This research was fully funded by Rockefeller University's Chemers Neustein Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF). Read our poster [here](/assets/files/Research/Neural Inter-area Interaction Poster.pdf).

**2023** <br>
I worked on a remote project on generative models in machine learning with Dr. Baptista from the California Institute of Technology. Our group researched the optimal transportation, Bayesian inferences, and data assimilation.
