I'm still building the other parts of this section! -- 02/05/2025

## **Summer programs**

**2024** <br>
I collaborated with Dr. Lucas Tian and Dr. Winrich Freiwald in the Laboratory of Neural Systems at Rockefeller University. We quantified inter-area interactions of neural representations during action sequences in macaque monkeys, as well as the hierarchical directionality of communication during actions. This research was fully funded by Rockefeller University's Chemers Neustein Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF). Read our poster [here](/assets/files/Research/Neural Inter-area Interaction Poster.pdf).

**2023** <br>
I worked on a remote project on generative models in machine learning with Dr. Baptista from the California Institute of Technology. Our group researched the optimal transportation, Bayesian inferences, and data assimilation.
