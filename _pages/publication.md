Open Science & Research Bias Statement: For every paper I publish as a first or co-first author, I commit to sharing all data, code, detailed methods, and non-significant results. Replication of my works is strongly encouraged with proper citations and [pre-registration](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg). **Science is for everyone** and I strive to make it equally accessible to all communities.

Read [selective reporting](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(14)00054-0) and  [selective analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2303) to avoid invalidate research!
